Maze Game Using Python
Developed an interactive maze game in Python, where players navigate through a series of challenges and obstacles to reach the exit. The game features user-friendly controls, dynamic gameplay, and engaging graphics. This project enhanced my programming skills and understanding of game development concepts, including algorithms for pathfinding and collision detection.
